I recently finished my PhD in Machine Learning at TU Darmstadt, Germany where I worked under the supervision of Johannes Fürnkranz. In March 2022, I started a PostDoc at the Computer Science department at UCL working on machine learning applied to the task of repurposing.

            During my PhD, my main research interest focused on representation learning. Particularly, how to learn appropriate representation for complex data and or in non standard setting. I have also worked a bit on analogical reasoning and learning to rank. <br/>
            Recently, I started working on neuro-symbolic reasoning, program synthesis, particularly on program induction from natural language and more applied topics targeting the theory of repurposing. <br/>
